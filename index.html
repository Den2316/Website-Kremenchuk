                    <article>
                        Built in 1910, times when Ukraine was a part of Russian Empire, the Church became one of the symbols of Kremenchuk. In Soviet times Church was never used for praying, but only used for administrational aims. Since in 1991 the USSR has broken down, activity in the Church came back to its original purposes and nowadays it functions as one of the churches of Ukrainian Orthodoxy.

                        First bridge on Dnipro river was built in 1879, however it was destroyed during WW2. In 1949 a new, Kryukiv Bridge, was constructed.It has length of 1.7 kilometers, supports both car, railway traffic, and has an option to be lifted in case of massive ferries wanting to drive through it. Nowadays this bridge is the only connection between two banks of Kremenchuk, however there are plans to build new bridges nearby.

                        Governmental Bank was built in 1900 and designed to be an official bank of Russian Empire. What's interesting about this place, is that it was one of not so many old buildings in Kremenchuk to survive WW2, avoid any harmful modifications since 1900 and still stand in the centre of the city.
